/*! @mainpage mimmo

<B>mimmo</B> is a C++ library for Manipulation and Morphing of surface/volume meshes (Open source). \n
\n
The main aim of <B>mimmo</B> is to provide a framework of tools able to handle a tessellated geometry and quickly modify it. It relies on
Radial Basis Function (<B>RBF</B>) and extended Free Form Deformation (<B>eFFD</B>) techniques to achieve it. \n
\n
Many efforts are spent to make <B>mimmo</B> a flexible platform, able to adapt to any User problem/need, and open to any customization. Its inner structure
is made by essential executable blocks, each one providing a basic feature, such as I/O handling, manipulating, selecting
sub-portion of target geometries, etc... \n
\n
Blocks are connectable between each other, so that they can describe a morphing workflow, easily
controllable by the User. \n
