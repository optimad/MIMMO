# Change Log
All notable changes to **mimmo** project will be documented in this file.

This library _tries_ to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Unreleased
### Fixed
- fixed get bounding box method of MimmoObject for parallel support
- fixed copy during compilation of binary samples additional files
- various bug fixes
### Added
- added parallel SkdTreeUtils: use new parallel version of SkdTree of bitpit library
- restored name in MimmoPiercedVector objects
- new methods to write geometries with several and different kind of fields (scalar/vector, defined on points/cells) added to BaseManipulation class
- added geometric tolerance to mimmo objects
- added use of geometric tolerance and cleaning flag during reading with MimmoGeometry objects
- added RefineGeometry class to handle refinement of surface mesh: ternary and red-green engines provided for triangular based meshes
- added IOWaveFrontOBJ to handle input/output of surface mesh in Wavefront OBJ format. Enabled class ManipulateWFOBJData to manipulate data attached to the OBJ mesh (texture, normal fields, cell groups)
- added new feature to MRBF manipulator class, i.e. the possibility to handle RBF node set with variable support radii.
### Changed
- update MimmoGeometry to export geometry object in a unique STL file during parallel processes
- Geometry container MimmoObject through MimmoSharedPointer: use custom mimmo smart pointer to exchange geometries through ports or set/get method of blocks interfaces.

- IOOFOAM class : OpenFoam class interface now depending on OpenFoam native libraries, instead on VTK.
                  User interface has changed. Compatibility is ensured fro 2.x, 3.x 4.x and 5.x OpenFoam
                  Foundation versions, and ESI-OpenFoam v1606+, v1806+.

- OBBox class : rework of basic workflow.
- SkdTreeUtils namespace : extractTarget method changed in algorithm and interface.
