* - a list of Ports identifiers (string basically), marking the input ports of receivers, where the data will be sent (m_portLink)
* - information on the container and data type exchanged (m_datatype)
*
* In general, a set of data (still not specified in this abstract class) of type m_datatype, written in a buffer stream m_obuffer,
* will be sent to a list of BaseManipulation objects/receivers. Input ports of receivers are responsible to decode the
* data buffer sent, and make available the data to their respective receveir.
*
* The execution of the output PortT will automatically
* exchange the buffer data, pass it to the input ports connected and makes them reading and decoding the data.
