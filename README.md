## About mimmo
**mimmo** is a C++ library for Manipulation and Morphing of surface/volume meshes (Open source).

The main aim of **mimmo** is to provide a framework of tools able to handle a tessellated geometry and quickly modify it.
It relies on direct transformation, Radial Basis Function (**RBF**) and extended Free Form Deformation (**eFFD**) techniques to achieve it.

Many efforts are spent to make **mimmo** a flexible platform, able to adapt to any User problem/need, and open to any customization. Its inner structure
is made by essential executable blocks, each one providing a basic feature, such as I/O handling, manipulating, selecting sub-portion of target geometries, etc... .

Blocks are connectable between each other through input/output ports, so that they can describe a morphing workflow, easily controllable by the User.
